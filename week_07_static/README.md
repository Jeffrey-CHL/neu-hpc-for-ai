# week_07_static

This package contains a **self-contained** Modal app (`main.py`) that writes
the CUDA project files **inside** the container at runtime (no local directory
mounting). This avoids the "was modified during build process" errors.

## How to run

```bash
cd week_07_static
modal run main.py::auto_run
```
